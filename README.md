```
**VaporTrace** is a high-performance Red Team framework engineered in Go for surgical reconnaissance and exploitation of API architectures. It specializes in uncovering "Shadow APIs," analyzing authorization logic (BOLA/BFLA), and mapping the entire attack surface of modern REST/Microservice environments.

> **Project Phase:** Engineering & Hardening: Refactoring Surgical Reporting & Vault Integration.
> **Research Status:** RED TEAM R&D / API SECURITY GAP ANALYSIS
> **Core Principle:** Logic-First Exploitation & Non-Destructive Ingestion

## 🖥️ The Tactical Shell: Persistence & Context

The **VaporTrace Shell** is the core differentiator of this framework. Unlike standard one-shot CLI tools, the shell provides a **Persistent Security Context** required for complex logic testing.

### Strategic Use Case: The "Ghost-Weaver" Pivot

In modern API pentesting, most vulnerabilities aren't found in a single request, but in the **logical relationship** between two accounts and background persistence.

* **Identity Management:** The shell maintains a global state for `Attacker` and `Victim` tokens. You configure them once, and the engine automatically handles the "Identity Swap" during probes.
* **Background Sovereignty:** The `weaver` command spawns a background agent that monitors for OIDC tokens and exfiltrates discovered loot via AES-256-GCM encrypted channels.
* **NHPP Evasion:** Every exfiltrated packet is masked as a `[WARN] Deprecated dependency` log to bypass basic automated traffic analysis.
* **Real-time Triage:** Integrated `pterm` tables provide immediate feedback on whether a request was blocked (403), missing (404), or successfully leaked (200 OK).

To enter the interactive tactical mode, execute:

```bash
./VaporTrace shell

```

vapor@trace:~$ auth attacker eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1...

# 3. Target a user-settings endpoint with a base JSON object
# The engine will attempt to inject 'is_admin', 'role', etc.
vapor@trace:~$ bopla [https://api.target.com/v1/user/me](https://api.target.com/v1/user/me) '{"name":"vapor"}'

## IV. DFIR RESPONSE GUIDANCE

#### **1. Detection & Analysis (ID.AN)**

* **Network Artifacts:** Monitor for anomalous traffic mirroring or the presence of the `X-VaporTrace-Signal` header. Watch for SSRF patterns targeting internal IP metadata ranges.
* **Endpoint Artifacts:** Audit for background processes renamed to `kworker_system_auth` or unauthorized access to `/proc/net/arp` and OIDC cache files.

#### **2. Containment & Eradication (PR.PT)**

* **Logic Hardening:** Implement Object-Level Authorization (OLA) at the middleware layer to mitigate BOLA.
* **Metadata Protection:** Enforce IMDSv2 with session-oriented headers to prevent unauthenticated credential harvesting.

---

## 📡 The Technology Behind the Tracer

* **Language:** Golang (Concurrency-focused, statically linked).
* **Database:** SQLite3 with async I/O worker pool for persistent mission tracking.
* **UI Stack:** `pterm` for tactical dashboarding and `readline` for shell interactivity.
* **Network Stack:** Custom `net/http` wrapper with `crypto/tls` overrides and robust `net/url` path handling.

**VaporTrace - Reveal the Invisible.**
